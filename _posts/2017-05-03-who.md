## Who Are We?

DataRescueWayne is a nonpartisan alliance of local programmers, librarians, and educators dedicated to maintaining public access to government data. We are part of the nationwide #DataRefuge project, inspired by the [PPEHlab](http://www.ppehlab.org/) at Penn State, and the Internet Archivesâ€™ [End of Term Project](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/2016.html). Our goal is raise awareness of the crucial role federal and state agencies play in data collection and storage, the value of that data to the Metro Detroit community, and especially its vulnerability to changing governmental priorities.
