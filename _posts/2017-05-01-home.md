# DataRescue Wayne State

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">We are sorry to report, this event has been cancelled.</span>

As priorities around identifying and resucing data have evolved, so to have the data resuce events that support those goals.  While this particular event has been cancelled, please stay tuned.  We are brainstorming ways to continue to the discussion and increase awareness around the importance and at-risk nature of government data.

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Help Save Federal/State Data at the #DataRescueWayne Event</span>

<span style="font-size:1.5em;">May 13 from 9 a.m. – 4 p.m.    
Undergraduate Library Community Room, 3rd Floor  
Wayne State University  
Detroit, MI 48202</span>

The federal government’s data belongs to you. Right now, that data is at risk for suppression and deletion for political reasons. On May 13th, as part of a nationwide data rescue initiative, **#DataRescueWayne is holding an event to create trustworthy copies of federal data from the Department of Education.**

The #DataRescueWayne event is an opportunity for programmers, educators, librarians, writers, activists and volunteers of all kinds to build community around fact-based arguments. Training will be provided, but please bring your own laptop and charger!
