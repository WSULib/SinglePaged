The federal government’s data belongs to you. Right now, that data is at risk for suppression and deletion for political reasons. On May 13th, as part of a nationwide data rescue initiative, **#DataRescueWayne is holding an event to create trustworthy copies of federal data from the Department of Education.**

The #DataRescueWayne event is an opportunity for programmers, educators, librarians, writers, activists and volunteers of all kinds to build community around fact-based arguments. Training will be provided, but please bring your own laptop and charger!
