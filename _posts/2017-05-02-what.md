## What Can I Do?

Tons. \#DataRescueWayne participants can choose from among several different tracks depending on their interests and skills.

- **[Seeding and Sorting](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/seeding/)**: This is the widest path and requires a variety of skill levels. Seeders identify important URLs, and identify whether or not those URLs can be / have been crawled by the Internet Archive's web crawler. **Because most Data Rescue events have focused on climate and other hard science data, rather than Department of Education data, there's lots of work to do here!**

- **[Researchers](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/researching/)** review URLs the Seeders & Sorters mark as “uncrawlable” to confirm that seeders’ assessments were correct (that is, that the URL/dataset is indeed uncrawlable), and investigate how the dataset could be best harvested. **Consider this path if you have a strong front end web experience or experience with web-based research.**

- **[Harvesters](https://datarefuge.github.io/workflow/harvesting/)** take the uncrawlable data and try to figure out how to actually capture it based on the recommendations of the Researchers. This is a complex task which can require substantial technical expertise, and which requires different techniques for different tasks. **Consider this path if you have programming skills.**

- **[Documenters & Storytellers](http://www.ppehlab.org/storytelling)** help record and publicize stories about the importance of education data to our city, our region, and our everyday lives, and share the work on social media. **Consider this path if you have skills in writing and social media.**
